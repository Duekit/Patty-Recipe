### Making the Dough

1. add flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and turmeric and mix thoroughly.

2. Rub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour.

3. Pour in 1/2 cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together.

4. Keep adding ice water 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time until the mixture forms a dough.

5. At this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it.

6. Alternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let it chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling.

### Making The Filling

1. Add ground beef to a large bowl. then Sprinkle in allspice and black pepper. Mix together and set it aside.

2. Heat oil in a skillet until hot.

3. Add onions and saute until translucent.

4. Add hot pepper, garlic, and thyme and continue to saute for another minute. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt.

5. Add seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let it cook until the meat is no longer pink.

6. Add ketchup and more salt for taste.

7. Pour in 2 cups of water and stir.

8. Boil the mixture then reduce heat and let it simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining is a thick sauce.

9. Fold in green onions. Remove from heat and let cool completely.
### Making the Patty
1. Beat the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside.

2. Now you can prepare the dough in two ways: in either two large pieces or smaller, individual pieces.
